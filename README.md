# odin_chess
This is a simple command-line chess game program created while following along with the Odin Project curriculum

Users can play a complete game of chess by choosing a piece to move and a corresponding location to move it to.

Any current game can be saved by inputting "save" in place of a chess piece. When run, the user is given the choice to resume a saved game.

It should be noted that this program is a simplified version of chess that omits castling and en passant for the sake of easing new players into the game.
Functionality for these moves may be added at a later date
